_Phase 0 – Data Science Foundations_

PHASE-0

 What I Did
- Created and set up GitHub repository geo-insight-ai.
- Wrote project_vision.md explaining how AI can help analyze rental/business locations.
- Learned Python fundamentals: data types, loops, functions, and OOP basics.
- Built a clean Location class to model geographical properties.
- Practiced data analysis using Pandas and NumPy.
- Analyzed a Mumbai housing dataset — cleaned missing values, converted price units (Cr/L), computed ₹ per sqft, and exported the cleaned file.

What I Learned
- How to use Git & GitHub for version control.
- How to handle and clean messy real-world data.
- How to write Python classes and methods.
- How to calculate derived features like price_per_sqft.
- Basics of reading/writing CSV files using Pandas.
